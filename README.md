# Single-Page-Application-using-ReCharts-library
This repo is specially for  Chanyoung Kwon @ Aizen

Here I have mimicked server's behaviour and data handling behaviour (instead of hardcoding everything right into charts). API.js has JSON object, that's passed from database, and some functionalities to handle JSON object and exports to index.js.

Index.js contains implementation of all components including charts. 

In order to label x-axis in two rows, CustomizedAxisTick component was created, mainly to change tick prop of xAxis Component.
